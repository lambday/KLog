Module for manipulating sequences of goals like lists.\vspace{0.7cm}

\begin{description}
    \predicate[nondet]{rmember}{2}{?A, ?B}
True when \arg{B} is a comma-separated sequence and \arg{A} occurs in
it. Similar to \predref{member}{2} for lists.

    \predicate[det]{rabsent}{2}{+A, +B}
True when \arg{B} is a comma-separated sequence and \arg{A} does not occur in
it.

    \predicate[det]{rappend}{3}{+A, +B, +C}
True if \arg{A}, \arg{B}, and \arg{C} are comma-separated sequences and \arg{C} is the
concatenation of \arg{A} and \arg{B}. Useful to generate "negative" edges
Warning: does not terminate if \arg{A} is a free variable.

    \predicate[det]{goals_to_list}{2}{+G, -L}
True if \arg{G} is a comma-separated sequence, and \arg{L} the corresponding
list of items.
Warning: does not terminate if \arg{G} is a free variable.

    \predicate[det]{list_to_goals}{2}{+L, -G}
True if \arg{L} is a list of items and \arg{G} the corresponding comma-separated
sequence Warning: does not terminate if \arg{L} is a free variable.
